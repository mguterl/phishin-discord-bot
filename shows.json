The band was short on equipment, so a hockey stick was used as a microphone stand. Between sets, the DJ spun some Michael Jackson and Trey drummed along to the album. The house music (which included more Michael Jackson) was presumably turned up after Fire to drown out the band. The setlist may be incomplete, though, as the master recording contains nothing after Trey&rsquo;s sarcastic comments about Michael Jackson following Fire. All songs were, of course, Phish debuts. Back in Black was teased before Scarlet Begonias. While this show is often billed as an ROTC Halloween Dance that took place on October 30, 1983, this is incorrect. The master copy of the recording of this show, as unearthed by Phish archivist Kevin Shapiro, contains a handwritten note that pegs the date as December 2, 1983. In discussions with Kevin, band members confirmed that they recall rehearsing for this show over the Thanksgiving Break, and that the show was a Christmas semi-formal. Also, it was not an ROTC-sponsored event; it was a dorm dance in a predominantly ROTC dorm (Mike&rsquo;s dorm at the time).",

The Paradise held around 650 people, they didn&rsquo;t think the band could come close to selling out the room and so refused to book Phish. John Paluska and Ben Hunter, who were managing Phish at the time, therefore rented the room for the evening. John and Ben promoted the gig heavily, including via radio. Tickets were only $5. Tom Baggott, a fan of the band, helped get Burlington fans to the show by Greyhound bus. Not only did the gig sell out, but there were some 200 people shut out (mostly Boston University and Boston College students). I Didn&#39;t Know featured Fish&nbsp;on trombone. Alumni contained additional lyrics. Prior to YEM, Trey welcomed his mom, who had come &quot;all the way from Ireland.&quot; After YEM, Trey said that they had a special guest that night for the person in the front row that kept requesting that they play Minkin. Trey mentioned that there was a Minkin hanging behind the band and that Minkin was also there that night. There was a subsequent brief Minkin vocal tease prior to Lizards. This version of Sanity was the fast version.",

It&#39;s true. He&#39;s dead.&quot; Stash was played by request for &quot;Big Phil&quot; Muller, and was preceded by Fish&nbsp;playing the <em>Charlie Chan<\/em> signal. Fish&nbsp;said &quot;he wrote it,&quot; Trey said &quot;probably because I wrote it,&quot; and Mike added &quot;I think it sucks. Essentially.&quot; Regarding Stash, Trey said &quot;I collaborated on this song writing the music end of it and the lyrics were written by another native New Jerseyian, Tom Marshall, who isn&#39;t here tonight, unfortunately, because he&#39;s gotta be at work tomorrow programming computers.&quot; Fish&nbsp;added &quot;for his dad&quot; and Trey responded &quot;My dad, he works for my dad. Keeping it all in the family here.&quot; Stash and La Grange contained Buried Alive teases. Prior to Landlady, Trey said they were going to play it in honor of their first gig in New Jersey. Mike introduced Destiny Unbound as a song he wrote about his Uncle Pendleton Vandiver. Prior to Buried Alive, Trey asked for a show of hands from the sparse crowd as to how many people in the room were actually from New Jersey and said &quot;we&#39;re going to play a song that we wrote that we think captures the spirit of New Jersey,&quot; calling it &quot;New Jersey And You, Perfect Together,&quot; which is the state&#39;s tourism slogan (a joke he later referenced in Golgi and Contact). Trey encouraged the crowd to &quot;sing along when the chorus comes, just like it&#39;s a big commercial, because we&#39;ll be filming this for the next New Jersey commercial.&quot; During I Didn&#39;t Know, Trey introduced Fish&nbsp;as &quot;Zero Man&quot; and the song&#39;s lyrics were changed to Pardon Me &quot;Zero Man.&quot; Before Contact, Trey introduced his dog Marley as &quot;the 5th member of the band who doesn&#39;t usually get as much recognition... and we&#39;re going to play Marley&#39;s favorite song -- at this moment in time.&quot;",

The HYHU outro featured Fish on trombone and later telling the crowd &quot;you paid for this, this is what you bought.&quot; Trey said &quot;If you only knew what a nightmare that was for poor Fish, having to listen to that song&quot; and Fish responded with &ldquo;they just do it out of HATE.&rdquo; Trey asked who could tell him who wrote that song, and a fan answered correctly. Trey said the fan won the $10,000 the other guy was going to give them to a play a song and Page said the fan won a date with Fish, with Trey adding &quot;and you can guarantee that he&#39;ll be late.&quot; After Golgi, Trey thanked the crowd, saying &quot;we&#39;ll be right back with more songs that Fish hates, more songs that we love, and more songs that people are willing to pay $10,000 to hear.&quot; Trey introduced Page as Leon before his piano solos in My Sweet One and Rocky Top. Before Fish&#39;s trombone solo in I Didn&#39;t Know, Trey mentioned the last time they played in the area (see 4\/11\/91), they made Fish get up and tell a joke (The Prison Joke) that was &quot;absolutely the stupidest joke ever&quot; and that he (Trey) wasn&#39;t going tell the punchline. Trey went on to explain that most people around here thought Fish was a pretty bad joke teller and he wanted to give him a chance to redeem himself.&nbsp; Fish&#39;s joke was &quot;Why did the Siamese twins go to England? To let the other one drive for a while.&quot; Page also teased HYHU while Trey talked. Adeline was sung from the balcony without microphones to open the encore.

Trey sang the verses of Fee through a megaphone for the first time since October 1, 1990&nbsp;(268 shows). Phish originals Axilla, Fast Enough for You, and Lengthwise debuted at this show, which also featured the Phish debut of I Walk The Line. The start of the second set included an Owner of a Lonely Heart tease. Mike&rsquo;s Song included an Under Pressure jam as well as an Axilla tease from Mike. Weekapaug was unfinished, included a vocal jam, and ended with a tease (with lyrics) of The&nbsp;Price of Love. Tweezer contained an I Walk The Line tease. The BBFCFM jam did not contain the song&#39;s usual lyrics - it instead featured lyrics from both I Walk The Line and Ring of Fire, as well as a brief Ring of Fire tease (from Page). Big Ball Jam also debuted, with Trey explaining the concept of the song, adding that it was written for Pete Schall. Poor Heart, Fast Enough for You and Llama featured Gordon Stone on pedal steel guitar. Trey introduced Fish as &ldquo;Eyeball Man&rdquo; before Lengthwise, which was performed in more of a reggae style than other versions and even featured a vacuum solo from Fish. After Lengthwise, Page said Fish wrote the song, with Trey adding that they liked it so much that it appeared twice on the album and both Page and Trey saying &quot;it&#39;s that good.&quot; The intro to Cavern contained Axilla teases from Trey. Bold As Love was played for the first time since April 18, 1990 (317 shows).<\/p>\r\n",

Slave contained Crimes of the Mind teases. Before the lights went out for the third set, the audience overheard the band before the set. Fish wound up saying I want a jumbo hot dog, large fries and shake delivered on stage. The band came out, started up My Sweet One, and was interrupted by an announcer asking who ordered the food. The band pointed at Fish, who looked confused as huge props of a hot dog, fries and shakes descended from the ceiling next to the drum set. The band played 2001 while the hot dog landed. The James Bond Theme was then broadcast over the PA while technicians (wearing Rocket Scientist jackets) prepared the hot dog, and the band climbed in with their instruments and flew out over the audience, as balloons popped and feathers, confetti and Phish NYE 1994 ping pong balls fell from the ceiling. Various music, including the Captain Beefheart song Tropical Hot Dog Night, was played over the P.A. as the hot dog space ship flew back and forth. Mike's maternal grandmother, Lillian Cherry, joined the band on stage for Chalk Dust with a shoe in her hand. This version of Bouncing appears on <em>A Live One<\/em>.",

Also, the second set was preceded by recorded Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' and Thriller teases from Michael Jackson's <em>Thriller <\/em>album. The second set \"musical costume\" was The Who's <em>Quadrophenia<\/em> and was performed with Dave Grippo on alto saxophone, Don Glasgo on trombone, Joey Sommerville on trumpet and Alan Parshley on French horn. During Bell Boy, crew member Leigh Fordham, clad in a bell boy outfit, sang Keith Moons original part. All of the <em>Quadrophenia<\/em> songs, as well as My Generation, were Phish debuts. YEM was almost 40 minutes long, contained teases from Trey of The Real Me and DEG, a Spooky tease from Page, and was preceded by the audience chess move. The chosen fan, dressed as a Wookiee, cracked under the pressure and could not choose a move on stage, prompting a quote from Fish that Wookiees cant play chess. The Rock was teased after the failed move. Jesus Just Left Chicago featured Grippo on alto saxophone; Suzy Greenberg featured Grippo, Glasgo and Somerville. My Generation was performed acoustic. Before My Generation, the crew set up a Keith Moon replica drum set on stage. After the song, Fish and Trey destroyed the drum set a la The Who. Finally, a stagehand brought out a large plunger. Trey pressed it and set off a huge explosion backstage. This show was officially released as <em>Live Phish 14<\/em>. In the soundcheck, Suzy Greenberg was performed three times: the first with only Grippo, the second with the band and Grippo, and the third with all of the horns, alternate lyrics, and Bell Boy quotes. The jam through the end of the soundcheck was played with horns.",

This show also marked the Phish debut of Gypsy Queen. During the Mockingbird narration, Trey told of a giant iguana that would take the crowd to Mars to view the life there.",

During Tweezer Reprise, the Art Tower was burned to the ground as The Great Went came to a close. As the Hood jam kicked in, Trey asked Chris to turn the lights off and the band jammed while the front section of the audience engaged in the first Hood glowstick war. Trey remarked to the crowd at the end of the jam that the visual display was cool.

The 11:00 a.m. announcement was that tickets would be sold at noon the vacant Pier 32, prompting a mad rush of fans to the waterfront. Of the several thousand who arrived, roughly four hundred lucky people were able to buy vouchers entitling them to a pair of tickets. Prior to Brian and Robert, Trey said that Fish used to hate the yellow light and that Fish used to have a list of things that he hated, adding that every time they found out something Fish hated, they&#39;d always do it (prompting Page to tease HYHU, which Fish also hates). Fish added that he hated the vowel &quot;ooo&quot; (the crowd responded with &quot;ooo&quot; noises). Trey said the only way to overcome something you hate was to face it head on. Trey then had Chris Kuroda shine a yellow light on Fish for Brian and Robert.&nbsp;Reba did not have the whistling ending. Hood contained a tease of Aaron Copland&rsquo;s Fanfare for the Common Man. After the show, some fans were given a poster (later for sale from Phish Dry Goods) and a bumper sticker (saying: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just come from Phish at the Fillmore. It was nice.&rdquo;).",

The Harpua narration picked up where the December 6, 1996 Harpua ended; Jimmy hitched a ride from Vegas to Salt Lake City and the driver was playing <em>Dark Side of the Moon<\/em>. <em>Dark Side<\/em> was reportedly chosen the day of the show, partially based on sluggish ticket sales for this one venue compared to the rest of the tour. All the <em>Dark Side <\/em>songs were Phish debuts except for Great Gig (last played July 5, 1994, or 332 shows), although the original album version of Speak to Me was piped through the P.A. on Halloween, 1994 and Breathe was jammed on October 25, 1995.

The dancers reappeared throughout the crowd and handed out thousands of glowrings to the fans just before a grand balloon drop and pyrotechnics display at midnight. The band counted the crowd into the New Year before busting into Auld Lang Syne.&nbsp;While some fans used the glowrings to start a Glowstick War during Hood, others used them to create long chain links of rings spanning the venue from end to end.",

The Makisupa key words were \"gooballs, brownies, stink, kind nugs... keef!\" Happy Birthday was performed for the first time since September 30, 1991 (715 shows) and was first played by Trey instrumentally over Makisupa before he announced Chris Kuroda's birthday and asked the crowd to join in as he sang the song \"rasta style\" (with a \"We're gonna get you so wasted tonight after the show\" lyric). Mike subsequently took a bass solo and Fish sung a verse solo in a mock Jamaican accent (with a \"You roll up a big spliff and you don't pass it to no one!\" lyric). Chris took a silent light board solo (see also April 18, 1990) at Trey's request before Makisupa resumed. The second set featured multiple teases and jams, including Antelope (Stash tease), Suzy (I Wish teases and a syncopated jam based around Page), and YEM (Boogie On Reggae Woman jam). In Purple Rain, played for the first time since August 6, 1996 (209 shows), Fish forgot the words and subsequently thanked the crowd for supporting his vacuum cleaner habit.",

The question centered on what all of the songs played in the first set, with the exception of Driver, had in common. The answer was that all songs were in the Key of D. Happy Birthday was also played (for Trey) during the contest announcement. Cities was an appropriate choice as an encore for Memphis, and Trey altered the lyrics a bit for the occasion.<\/p>\r\n",

			"setlist_notes": "This was the second show of the Big Cypress festival. Fish was introduced as 'Soda Jerk' during I Didnt Know. Split Open and Melt and Disease were unfinished. Melt contained A Love Supreme teases. After the ensuing Catapult, Trey remarked: Only at the largest concert in the world could we get away with playing a song like that. After Midnight made its Phish debut. The late set, also known as The Show, began at around 11:35. Father Time was on stage, pedaling on an exercise bike that powered a large clock. The sounds of the clocks gears could be heard through the sound system. About ten minutes before midnight, Father Time collapsed from exhaustion and the clock stopped. Then, a large fan boat entered the concert field and approached the stage. Early in its journey, the fan boat exploded away and revealed the hot dog used in the 1994 New Years stunt. While the band rode the hot dog to the stage, an instrumental version of Meatstick began to play over the P.A.. The band reached the stage and fed several meatsticks to Father Time, reviving him so that the clock could continue moving toward midnight. The band then took the stage and played Meatstick to begin The Show. Dancers were on stage prior to Phish reaching it. Auld Lang Syne and Disease were accompanied by fireworks. Heavy Things was recorded live and rebroadcast as part of ABC televisions New Years Eve coverage. In a humorous effort to confuse the home audience, Trey instructed the crowd to yell the word cheesecake in lieu of cheering at the end of the song. After twice giving the example of yelling the word once, Trey changed his mind and instructed the crowd to chant it, adding for them to say it like they were pissed. Trey then introduced the band for the rebroadcast and offered a message of peace and harmony for the world where he reminded people to drive in the right lane unless passing another vehicle. Meatstick was subsequently teased as the New Year approached in the central time zone. YEM included a vocal jam based around the word cheesecake and Trey altered the lyrics to Axilla and Albuquerque to reference the word. Inlaw Josie Wales featured Trey on acoustic guitar. Sand contained Quadrophonic Toppling quotes and My Soul teasing from Mike. Rock and Roll included an After Midnight tease. Love You included band introductions; Fish introduced Page before the song and Mike and Trey afterwards, and the band as Phish 2000 (see November 2, 1990). Piper contained Bug teases from Page. 2001 began with the signature Hood drum roll. After the show closed with yet another version of Meatstick, the Beatles song Here Comes the Sun was piped through the crowd at sunrise. Two breakouts were played: Crosseyed and Painless (first since August 13, 1997, or 159 shows), and Love You (first since July 5, 1997, or 179 shows).",

Antelope included Meatstick teases in the intro. At the end of the second set, Trey thanked the crew (particularly Carini, for being a good sport). Trey mentioned how much of a &ldquo;home show&rdquo; it is for the band to play in Holmdel, and led one final Meatstick tease.",

Prior to Wilson, a scene from the Tom Hanks movie <em>Cast Away <\/em>was played in the arena (referring to Hanks character searching for his volleyball\/companion named Wilson).

Appropriately, Seven Below began about seven minutes before midnight. During the song, the crew lowered a disco ball from the scoreboard and created a snowfall on stage. Dancers dressed in white as snow creatures took the stage and circled the band before dispersing into the crowd. Some of the dancers ascended ladders and donned stilts to become snow angels. At midnight, white balloons and confetti were dropped on the crowd. A dwarf remained on each front corner of the stage, popping balloons, while the snow angels continued to dance. Runaway Jim contained a Weekapaug tease from Page. Time Loves a Hero was last played August 11, 1998 (or 151 shows).

Trey then humorously announced that the band would next play the longest Bittersweet Motel (traditionally one of the shortest songs in the Phish canon) while Page teased \"Charge!\" The crowd responded with a passionate Fluffhead chant, but Trey responded: Mike says no (prompting laughs from the other band members). Appropriately, Trey launched into Mikes Song but Mike had the last laugh: during the Mikes Song intro, Mike sang his Hendge lyric that had been omitted from Wilson. YEM contained the event-appropriate lyrical change Boy, Man, God, IT, a Frankenstein tease from Mike, and a vocal quote of Daniel Saw the Stone. The band vamped on the theme to <em>Chariots of Fire<\/em> (a Phish debut) while Trey introduced the top finishers in the Runaway Jim 5K race. During Antelope, Trey thanked the staff, road crew, caterers (part of the reason were playing so well is because we have the best food this tour that weve ever had), and fans. He concluded by encouraging everyone to drive safely and noted tongue-in-cheek that next years IT 2 would have a traffic-free entrance. Antelope also included Under Pressure and Its Ice teases.",

NICU contained Shafty teases from Mike. Weigh was played for the first time since August 2, 1998 (200 shows). Gin included Show Biz Kids teases. 2001 included a P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up) jam containing some brief lyrics, as well as Gin, Auld Lang Syne, and The Little Drummer Boy teases. Tube was unfinished. L.A. Woman was a Phish debut; Birds included L.A. Woman teases. During Makisupa, Trey noted that they were going to play Touch Me, but decided not to because Fish couldn't remember the words and they didn't know how have a horn section. To make it up to the crowd for letting them down, Trey brought out George Clinton and Parliament\/Funkadelic (also known as The P. Funk All-Stars). Trey commented and thats even<em> better<\/em> than Touch Me! Page teased Touch Me while Trey was talking. The ensuing P. Funk Jam moved through pieces of several classic Parliament\/Funkadelic tunes including Butt-a-Butt, Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker), P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up), and One Nation Under A Groove. Get Low (Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz) was also part of the medley. By the end of the jam, Fish was alone on stage playing vacuum. Fish then exited, leaving the stage empty. Phish returned alone to finish Makisupa; to prove that P. Funk was better than Fish singing Touch Me, Makisupa closed with Fish singing the first line of Touch Me <em>a cappella.<\/em> During the last chorus of Contact, Trey sang lines like L.A. Woman and Make my funk the P. Funk in place of his usual harmonies.<\/p>\r\n",

Weekapaug included Jungle Boogie lyrics and a Divided Sky tease; Weekapaug, YEM, First Tube, and Chalk Dust also included Auld Lang Syne teases. Seven Below was unfinished. The house music played over the P.A. during the second setbreak consisted solely of songs that referenced &ldquo;cars&rdquo; in their titles. As midnight neared during Jungle Boogie (a Phish debut), Fish&rsquo;s drum kit was wheeled to the side of the stage. An Austin Cooper Mini automobile was lowered to the stage from above. The Miami Palmetto Senior High Band and cheerleading squad emerged from the car one-by-one, giving the impression that they were all in the car together. In reality, the car had touched down over a trap door in the stage and the guests came out from underneath. Also emerging were dancers similar to the bunny-women present at the IT Festival. The marching band joined in on the jam that emerged from Jungle Boogie. With the stage covered with marching band members and dancers (some even on top of Page&rsquo;s baby grand piano), an emcee (dressed in an Eddie George, Tennessee Titans, #27 football jersey) counted the clock down to midnight. A massive balloon drop followed. Phish then led the marching band through an instrumental version of Iron Man (also a Phish debut). Reba did not have the whistling ending. For his &ldquo;first song of 2004,&rdquo; in honor of the Miami Heat, Fish&nbsp;performed the Phish debut of Feel the Heat, which contained Fame quotes from Trey and Fish.&nbsp;HYHU contained more references to &ldquo;Henrietta&rsquo;s Heat&rdquo; as Fish&nbsp;took laps around the stage. Frankenstein was preceded by a Fluffhead tease.",

Throughout the duration of the set, groups of fans held the trampolines above their heads, and some&nbsp;fans jumped on the trampolines as well. Tom Marshall sang the lyrics to Antelope. Trey teased Waves in Halley&#39;s Comet. Before Bowie, Trey told a story of the summer he spent living in a cabin in the Northeast Kingdom where he remembered writing several songs, including Bowie. Trey explained that Bowie was an attempt to see &ldquo;how far can you push it in the harmonic and rhythmic language and still have people dancing.&rdquo; During Hood, Trey (speaking in rhythm) noted that because there were a row of rocks separating the band from the crowd, they were feeling a certain level of disconnect (particularly&nbsp;when Mike plays a &quot;sexy&quot; note). To remedy the situation, Trey and Mike ventured down onto the rocks for the duration of the song. At the end of Hood, the band stopped playing, allowing the audience to sing the &ldquo;You can feel good, good, good about Hood&rdquo; refrain.",

			"setlist_notes": "This was the second show of the Coventry festival and was the presumed &ldquo;Final Show.&rdquo;&nbsp;When Trey made his &ldquo;break-up&rdquo; announcement the preceding May, he indicated that Coventry would be the final Phish shows. In reality, this turned out to be the final public show for over four and a half years. This show was simulcast in movie theaters nationwide. Before Anything But Me, Trey announced that, for the first time in 21 years, he was nervous performing a Phish show. During Wolfman&rsquo;s, Trey revealed that the Wolfman&rsquo;s Brother is, in fact, Fish (as well as the fact that he handed the phone to his friend Liz Durfee). Also, during Wolfman&rsquo;s, Trey and Mike invited their mothers onstage (and later John Paluska) to do the &ldquo;sexy bump&rdquo; dance. Disease was unfinished and featured Trey briefly playing his guitar with a glow stick. Both Page and Trey broke down during an especially emotional Velvet Sea. After a thoroughly botched Glide, all four band members offered words of thanks to the fans for their continued support and dedication and brief reflections on their twenty years together. Trey then stated that what they really needed to do was &ldquo;blow off some fucking steam&rdquo; before starting up Melt. There was an enormous glow stick war during Ghost featuring hundreds, if not thousands, of orange glow sticks. This version of Seven Below saw all of the band members sporadically shouting &ldquo;Seven Below&rdquo; throughout the jam. The Phish debut of Cool Jerk contained alternate lyrics honoring monitor mixer, Mark &ldquo;Bruno&rdquo; Bradley. The Dickie Scotland Song was spontaneously created and included lyrics in honor of production manager, Hadden Hipsley, and tour accountant, Richard Glasgow (a.k.a. Dickie Scotland). Before Wilson, Trey asked the crowd to sing to another of their friends &ldquo;for the last time.&rdquo; There was a fireworks display between the end of the third set and the encore. Before the encore, while explaining the origins of The Curtain, Trey jokingly announced that the entire Chicago Symphony and the Twyla Tharp Dance Troupe were going to perform Gamehendge. Trey explained that they chose The Curtain With as the last song to bring them full circle, because, not only was it one of the first Phish songs he wrote, but he wrote it in a cabin one town over from Coventry. Trey stopped and restarted the jam segment of the Curtain With, because they were in the wrong key or, as he explained, &rdquo;Since we are going to be bringing ourselves back in time, we may as well do it in the correct key.&rdquo; There was no P.A. music after the Curtain With.",

The first set, which started at noon, was billed as Phish&#39;s &quot;first full-length acoustic set&quot; (complete with complimentary coffee and Festival 8 themed donuts). The first set featured Trey and Mike on acoustics, Page solely on piano, and a unique stage setup&nbsp;that had Fish&nbsp;stage right with Page on the far left. Before Brian and Robert, Trey encouraged the crowd to sit down due to the &quot;mellow&quot; nature of the set; he added that they had never before played to a crowd that was sitting. Whether the crowd should stand up or sit down became a running joke throughout the set, until Trey confessed during Wilson that he only asked the crowd to sit down at the request of the crew and, in fact, he hates telling people what to do (and also hates sitting down). This show marked the Phish debuts of Invisible and Sleep Again. Fish&nbsp;performed a whistle solo on My Sweet One. The band briefly left the stage after McGrupp, returning to encore with Driver, Talk, and Secret Smile. The second and third sets were played later that evening.&nbsp;Reba lacked the whistling ending. Trey took a moment before Tweeprise to thank those who helped put on the festival.",

Demand was played for the first time since November 14, 1996 (392 shows). NO2 was played for the first time since July 13, 1999 (219 shows). Prior to the third set, a pedestal stating 2010 was placed on the front of the stage and a covered structure was placed behind Fish&#39;s drumset. During DWD, as the clock turned midnight, hundreds of balloons were released upon the crowd, fireworks went off on each side of the stage, and a disco ball was lowered onto the pedestal. After DWD, Trey opened the ball and Fish&nbsp;climbed inside. Trey and Mike, with some help from stagehands, proceeded to put the ball in a giant cannon aimed towards a giant net hanging from the rafters with an illuminated &ldquo;X&rdquo; on it. Page hit the trigger and purportedly &quot;blasted&quot; the ball through, not only the net, but also the roof of the arena. A searchlight appeared to come through the roof and was accompanied by helicopter sounds. With Fish&nbsp;apparently shot out of the venue, Trey asked if anybody knew how to play the drums and ended up finding Sarah, a girl from Pittsburgh. Trey asked how long she had played the drums and what her favorite song was and she responded with six months and Fluffhead respectively. Sarah was surreptitiously replaced by Fish, now wearing a dress identical to Sarah&#39;s and a black wig, who played the entire third set and encore, but Sarah came out at the end of the third set and bowed with the band instead of him. Blue Moon was a Phish debut and was performed as an instrumental while Trey thanked the entire crew. After the show, the disco ball was revealed to have &quot;crashed&quot; into a white car that had been parked in front of the American Airlines Arena with a sign on the windshield stating &quot;This car was driven down from Vermont&quot; and &quot;fueled by maple syrup.&quot; &nbsp;After being &ldquo;struck&rdquo; by the &ldquo;human cannonball,&rdquo; the car was emitting smoke and leaking maple syrup and the entire area was cordoned off with police tape.&nbsp;",

In the tradition of some of Phish&#39;s previous crowd experiments in the early &#39;90s, flyers explaining a new Secret Language prank were included in the Phishbills that were passed out to fans as they walked into the show. The prank, designed to confuse those who would later listen to the recording, consisted of an announcer introducing Phish (as Little Feat). When the announcer would say a letter of the band FEAT (&quot;Give me an F!&quot;), the crowd would respond with letters corresponding to PHISH (&quot;P-H!&quot;). All of the songs in the second set other than Time Loves a Hero were Phish debuts. All of the songs in the second set, other than Don&#39;t Bogart That Joint and Willin&#39;, featured Giovanni Hidalgo on percussion. A five piece horn section consisting of Aaron Johnson, Stuart Bogie, Ian Hendrickson-Smith, Michael Leonhart and Eric Biondo joined the band for Old Folks Boogie, Time Loves a Hero, Day or Night, Mercenary Territory, Spanish Moon, Dixie Chicken, Rocket in My Pocket and Feats Don&#39;t Fail Me Now. Willin&#39; featured Page on bass, Mike on piano, Trey on drums and Fish on vocals. Prior to the piano solo at the beginning of Willin&#39;, Fish remarked, &quot;That&#39;s supposed to be Bill Payne on the keyboard.&quot; Don&#39;t Bogart That Joint was performed <em>a cappella<\/em>.

An amp (with the steam kettle on it), a keytar, a bass, a vacuum, and a few lights were then lifted off the stage. A woman in the front of the stage tossed a &ldquo;Steam&rdquo; sign into the front row, then rose with a barricade and security guard before eventually being lifted up over the band. Several other aerialists (clothed in various casual attire, equipped with black backpacks emitting smoke and lights on their backs) subsequently rose up from the crowd and ascended and descended several times. The first aerialist counted down to midnight, at which point balloons were released from the ceiling. The aerialists later returned with lights in their hands for Down with Disease, which also featured Trey and Mike being raised up and back down a few times before finally rising several feet on hydraulic lifts. Steam contained a Spooky tease from Trey and Disease was unfinished.",

Fish suggested they play In A Hole, but Trey said he could not remember it. He agreed to sing the chorus, however, and sang part of it briefly (emphasizing&nbsp;the pun on the &quot;a hole&quot; lyric)&nbsp;while Fish and Page played a small&nbsp;part of the music of the song&#39;s chorus. &quot;It&#39;s just as funny as it was 30 years ago,&quot; Page noted. &quot;Thank you for laughing.&quot; Fluffhead contained a Dave&#39;s Energy Guide tease.",

Prior to the start of Set II, the stage was cleared of all band equipment, and a graveyard set was brought out. At the start of the set, smoke filled the stage, and zombies appeared behind the gate. When the gate opened, a large haunted house with the band inside was brought to the front of the stage. The sound effects and narration were played on the PA, while an undead narrator would emerge from a crypt inscribed with &quot;ESTHER&quot;&nbsp;prior to each song for&nbsp;the introduction. At the end of The Fuse, the sides of the house came down while sounds of an explosion were heard, and the band was revealed inside, dressed in white tuxedoes and with zombie face paint. Several zombies came to the front of the stage and danced during Martian Monster. At the conclusion of the set, the band members came down from the Haunted House riser, slowly walked to the front of the stage, and took bows, along with the entire cast of zombies.

For that set, the band performed in elaborate costumes (helmets and all), with alternate instruments (Trey on a BCR Mockingbird), each playing within a flashing\/glowing shape (two circles and two squares), after descending (in the form of holograms) from the ceiling in cylinders of colored light. Knuckle Bone Broth Avenue included extended choreography by Trey and Mike. During Get More Down, matching upright geometric shapes danced around behind the band, reducing to the two circles overlapped by Egg in a Hole, which featured pyrotechnics. Before Clear Your Mind, Trey introduced the band as from the year 4680 (the total of the October 28, 2021 songs as noted during that night's encore-ending Grind). During The 9th Cube, there were projections of donuts and turtles on a cube above the band. Fireworks rained down on the stage during The Inner Reaches of Outer. For I Am in Miami, Trey switched to an acoustic guitar and the band stood together at stage front with the four-mic a cappella setup. After the set, the band departed as holograms back up the colored tubes. Soul Planet contained Knuckle Bone Broth Avenue and Don't Doubt Me quotes. Mike quoted Thanksgiving in Death Don't Hurt Very Long. The start of Harry Hood included alternate lyrics (Holy Blankenstein).",
